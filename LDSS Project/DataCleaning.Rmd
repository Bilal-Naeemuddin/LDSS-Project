## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#qt(0.05,lower.tail = FALSE)

2*(1-pt(0.7268787,9))

qnorm(0.1,lower.tail = FALSE)
pnorm(-0.6034,lower.tail = FALSE)

apple_mobility <- read.csv("apple mobility trends.csv") 
apple_mobility

Unemployement <- read.csv("unemployment rate.csv")
Unemployement 

us_covid <- read.csv("us_counties_covid19_daily.csv")
us_covid
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
#Clean data
apple_mobility2 <- select(apple_mobility,-c(geo_type,sub.region,country,alternative_name)) 
#apple_mobility2

Unemployement_before_covid <- slice(Unemployement,1:868)
Unemployement_during_covid <- slice(Unemployement,868:875)


us_covid

```


```{r}
#cases from jan 21st 2020 --> march 10th 2020
setDT(us_covid)
Total_case = us_covid[ , .(cases = mean(cases)), by = .(state)] %>%
  arrange(desc(cases))

Total_case %>%   
  mutate(cases=round(Total_case$cases,digits = 0)) 


jan_cases <- summarize(us_covid,jan = sum(us_covid$cases[1:39]))
feb_cases <- summarize(us_covid,feb = sum(us_covid$cases[40:398]))
mar_cases <- summarize(us_covid,mar = sum(us_covid$cases[399:1000]))

```


```{r}
ggplot(Total_case,aes(x=state,y=cases))+ geom_bar(stat="identity", position=position_dodge(width=100)) + scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(n.dodge=1))+ theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) + 
  xlab("States") + ylab("Covid Cases") + ggtitle("Number of Cases by State")

```


```{r}

ggplot(Unemployement_before_covid,aes(x=UNRATE),binwidth=20) + geom_histogram()

```
  In the first graph, it is a histogram that shows the unemployment rate from 1948 to march 2020. The graph is clearly skewed to the right which would suggest that the unemployment rate is typically around 6% how ever if we take a look at the recent unemployment rates during covid..
  
```{r}

ggplot(Unemployement_during_covid,aes(x=DATE,y=UNRATE)) + geom_point()

```

We can see that there is a negative relationship between the unemployment rate and the date. This is because when lockdown started,
unemployment rates drastically increased and all of the managers did not know the procedures and protocols of a pandemic. This led to drastic changes in our everyday life and after a few months, notably after April the unemployment rates began decreasing again as most businesses were successful in implementing a way to get their workers to work in a good health and safety environment which would reduce the risk in getting the virus. The pandemic has taught us how to adapt to a pandemic and now we know that if another outbreak of a new virus happens in the future, we will be able to stop it before it gets out of hand unlike this one. According to CIDRAP news, about 20 million jobs were lost due to the pandemic.

```{r}
H3N2_Pandemic <- slice(Unemployement_before_covid,241:248)
bp<- ggplot(H3N2_Pandemic, aes(x=DATE, y=UNRATE, fill=DATE))+
geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity")
pie <- bp + coord_polar("y", start=0)
pie
ggplot(H3N2_Pandemic,aes(x=UNRATE,y=DATE),binwidth=20) + geom_bin2d() 

```

This graph represents the unemployment rate during the H3N2 Pandemic and as shown it was much less harmful than covid has been. It also seems that the unemployment rate was consistently at about 3.6% which is a normal average of unemployment compared to every year up until covid, it seems that the covid-19 pandemic was something that has never been seen before in human history, due to a lack of precautions, covid-19 was able to spread around the entire globe within months of its arrival.
