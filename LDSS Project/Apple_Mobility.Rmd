## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{}
qnorm(0.07/2, lowertail = False)
apple_mobility <- read.csv("apple mobility trends.csv") 
apple_mobility
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{}
apple_mobility2 <- select(apple_mobility,-c(geo_type,sub.region,country,alternative_name)) 
apple_mobility2
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
